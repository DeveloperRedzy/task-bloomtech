### âœ… Phase 7.5: Bug Fixes & Quality Improvements (COMPLETED)

**Critical Bug Fixes:**

- [x] **Search Descriptions Filter**: Fixed search functionality that wasn't filtering work entries by description
- [x] **Timezone Issues**: Resolved 2-hour time shift in work entry display and editing forms
- [x] **Sort By Dropdown**: Fixed API parameter mismatch causing "Invalid query parameters" error
- [x] **Duration Range Filter**: Implemented client-side filtering for min/max hours range
- [x] **Time Format Display**: Updated Average Hours to show "2h 30m" instead of "2.50h"

**Technical Improvements:**

- **Client-Side Filtering**: Enhanced WorkEntriesTable with proper search and duration filtering
- **Timezone Handling**: Fixed form input conversion from local time to UTC and display conversion
- **API Parameter Validation**: Corrected Sort By values to match API expectations (`'startTime'` vs `'date'`)
- **User Experience**: Improved empty state messages with detailed filter information
- **Consistent Formatting**: Applied human-readable time format across all statistics displays

**Components Enhanced:**

- `WorkEntriesFilters.tsx`: Removed invalid sort options, fixed parameter mapping
- `WorkEntriesTable.tsx`: Added comprehensive client-side filtering with search and duration range
- `WorkEntriesPage.tsx`: Fixed filter parameter passing and timezone conversion
- `EditWorkEntryForm.tsx`: Corrected timezone handling in form pre-population
- `validations.ts`: Fixed time conversion from form input to API format
- `StatsDashboard.tsx`: Applied consistent time formatting for statistics

**Quality Improvements:**

- **Error Prevention**: Fixed hooks violation that was causing React runtime errors
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensured time entries display exactly as entered (no timezone shifts)
- **Filter Reliability**: All filters now work correctly with proper user feedback
- **Consistent UX**: Unified time display format across all components
- **Robust Validation**: Enhanced parameter validation to prevent API errors
